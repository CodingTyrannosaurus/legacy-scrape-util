# Static Files

Methods of [data acquisition](./data-acquisition.md) which
read from static files end up sharing a decent amount of
generic boilerplate.  For this reason, special `static`
data-acquisition methods can be created.


## Overview

The `static` acquisition method supports the rapid development
and standardization of file parsers by providing a simple
interface by which new parsers can be added, and forcing
a set of unified behaviors on all parsers.  What we may lose in
potential 'optimizations' by doing this, we more than make up for
by greatly simplifying configuration and troubleshooting across
file parsing implementations.


## Config

```toml
[acquire]
type = "static"
suffix = "csv"
source = "path/to/csv/files/" # optional

[acquire.parser]
type = "hoboware"
# args to be passed to the parser go here.


[acquire.moveto] # optional section
fmt = "move/here/on/success/"
err = "move/here/on/failure/"
```

````javascript
{
  "type"   : "static",
  "source" : "path/to/csv/files/", // optional
  "suffix" : "csv",
  "moveto" : { // optional
    "fmt" : "path/to/successes/" // where to put originals on success
    "err" : "path/to/errors" // where to put originals on failure
  },
  "parser" : {
    "type" : "hoboware"
    ... // parser configurations go here
  }
}

````


## Development Notes

Need to decide if the parser implementation
gets passed a file path or a file pointer...
